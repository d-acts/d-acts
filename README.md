# D-acts Ontology

This repository is primarily for the developers of the D-acts and co-related projects. It contains the source code for the D-acts ontology and discussions.

## About

The ontology was created by [Mathias Brochhausen](https://medicine.uams.edu/dbmi/team/mathias-brochhausen-ph-d/). It is based on a theory of document acts proposed by Barry Smith and Reinach's theory of social acts and legal entities. See:

- Reinach, A. (1989), Sämtliche Werke. Texkritische Ausgabe, Edited by Karl Schuhmann and Barry Smith, München: Philosophia Verlag.

- Smith, B. (2008) “Searle and de Soto: The new ontology of the social world”, The Mystery of Capital and the Construction of Social Reality, B. Smith, D.M. Mark, and I. Ehrlich, United States, Open Court., 35-52.

- Smith, B. (2012) "How to Do Things With Documents", Rivista di estetica, 50 (2/2012), LII: 179-198.

However, there are some amendments from our side which are documented via the Issue Tracker and the commits.
